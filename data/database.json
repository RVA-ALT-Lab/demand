Wiggins suggests that the dedication (\"Illustrisimo principi: magnae brittaniae\") (f. 3r) may have been meant for Prince Henry rather than King James.\n\nIn June 1622, while in Alicante, Spain, London merchant Nicholas Leate transcribed the play from a lost exemplar that was probably an authorial manuscript bearing revisions for performance. Leate had been involved with the Levant Company and its pirate-hunting activities at the time that Verney was a pirate in the Mediterranean (1608-1615).\n\nRather than copy the revised version of the play as it appeared in his exemplar, Leate transcribed the original version (the version that had been superseded by the revisions). He recorded the revisions, however, in an appendix (ff. 42r-46v), noting the specific folio and speech number (which he added in the margins on the pages to which the appendix refers) of the location of the revisions (on this, see Pangallo).\n\nThe title page states that the volume includes also \"othere poeticall verses\" (f. 1r), but no such verses appear in the volume. A later hand, in a lighter ink, wrote a cipher of numbers, letters, and Greek letters on the title page. On the final page of the play proper, Leatt signed the page (f. 41v) and dated it \"Allicante \/ Junij: 10mo: \/ 1622\"; the \"1622\" was altered by a later hand to 1642. On the title page, the lines \"written by mee Nico. Leatt Jun. \/ in Allicant In June: 1622 :\/:\" were struck through with thick lines in black ink.\n\nThe Bodleian's summary catalogue entry mis-identifies the scribe as \"N. Leath\" and states incorrectly that the revisions described in the appendix were \"variations\" from \"another copy\" of the play.","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"Antipo","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"MS Eng.poet.e.5","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":358,"value":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/SummaryCatalogueVolVI\/page\/n41","fieldName":"Link to Library Catalogue Entry","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5563","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1622","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"964","type":"78","title":"1622 Scribal copying without revision | Leate, Nicholas, Italic","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":437,"value":{"id":"961","type":"55","title":"The Pirate, the Pirate-Hunter, and the Beginning of Early Modern Play Editing.

Peter Beal confirms this identification (http:\/\/www.celm-ms.org.uk\/repositories\/worcester-college-oxford.html#worcester-college-oxford_id723560). \n\nAn additional leaf was inserted into the manuscript (f. 78+); because it is larger than the rest of the leafs, it was folded to fit into the volume.\n\nThe manuscript was trimmed at some point, resulting in the loss of some parts of letters in the outer margins.\n\nIn October 1661, Samuel Pepys saw it performed and described it as \"the first time it hath been acted this twenty-five years\" (Bentley, 3:146); this would suggest that it was last performed in 1636. However, the play was included in an August 1641 list of King's Men plays that the Lord Chamberlain prohibited stationers to publish without permission from the troupe, which might suggest that it was still part of their repertory (Bentley, 3:145). \n\nA. H. Bullen edited the play from the Harley MS 7650 manuscript and was unaware of the 1649 printed edition. He assigned the play entirely to Shirley and titled it \"Captain Underwit\".\n\nThe manuscript (Harley MS 7650) is not included in the British Library's online Archives & Manuscripts Catalogue, nor does it appear in the 4-volume printed catalogue published in 1808 (which only runs through Harley MS 7639). An undated handwritten annotation has been added to the printed catalogue in the British Library Manuscripts Reading Room: \"7650 - Formerly Add 5001 - 'A Play - No Name'\".","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"The Country Captain","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"Harley MS 7650","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":358,"value":"[see Detailed Description and Commentary]","fieldName":"Link to Library Catalogue Entry","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5555","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"946","type":"76","title":"Date: 1639-1641 \n| The King's Men \n| Blackfriars,The Globe","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5506","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1640-1642","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"947","type":"78","title":"1640-1642 Scribal copying without revision,Scribal correcting | Unidentified, Mixed","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"950","type":"78","title":"1640-1642 Scribal correcting,Scribal revising | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"951","type":"78","title":"1640-1642 Authorial correcting,Authorial revision (subsequent) | Cavendish, William, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"952","type":"78","title":"1640-1642 Scribal copying without revision,Scribal correcting | Rolleston, John, Italic","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":438,"value":{"id":"926","type":"51","title":"The Country Captain, by William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle Johnson, Anthony, Woudhuysen, Henry R. 1999","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Modern Editions","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":438,"value":{"id":"929","type":"51","title":"Captain Underwit: A Comedy Bullen, A.

The leaves are marked with a crozier mark which has the letters ILESACE at the bottom. A fine silk gauze has been added to all but fols. 3, 9, 27, and 28, to reinforce the pages, but it tends to obscure the text beneath. Ink has bled on many of the pages, making much of the text extremely difficult to read.\n\nPlay is written in the same hand (Italian, with a mix of secretary forms) and with the same ink throughout. Some additions appear in fresher ink, likely after the play was fully transcribed. There is debate whether it is an autograph transcription and whether the alterations were added in the same or a separate hand. Greg maintained it was written out by a professional scribe, with no evidence of being autograph. Clifford Leech and Malone claim that it is, in fact, autograph.\n\nEach Scene lists characters involved and each Act ends with an 'Explicit.' There is space for a Prologue on the blank pages preceding the body of the play (ff 2v-3r) and the heading of 'Epilogue' at the end of the play (f. 28v) but neither was ever written into the manuscript.","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"The Queen of Corsica","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"Lansdowne MS 807","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":358,"value":"http:\/\/searcharchives.bl.uk\/primo_library\/libweb\/action\/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=IAMS040-002077606&indx=1&recIds=IAMS040-002077606&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&dscnt=0&frbg=&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BL%29&tab=local&dstmp=1555885356844&srt=rank&mode=Basic&&dum=true&vl(freeText0)=Lansdowne%20MS%20807&vid=IAMS_VU2","fieldName":"Link to Library Catalogue Entry","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5565","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1642","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":437,"value":{"id":"939","type":"55","title":"Francis Jaques: Author of The Queene of Corsica.

The warning directions are in the left margin and typically occur approximately twenty lines before the entrance.\n\nGreg wonders whether the deletion of a reference to \"the raigne of this kinge heere\" (f. 18r) might indicate censorship by the Master of the Revels (279). Nothing else in the manuscript indicates censorship, however, and there is no license.\n\nIt is possible that a blank first leaf was once part of the manuscript. \n\nDamp stains and decay appear on the bottom of all the leaves throughout, obscuring text in some places (these damp stains align with the same stains appearing on the manuscript of \"The Parliament of Love\"). The library catalogue record states that this damage was caused by mice.\n\nThe manuscript was bound around 1821 by Joseph Haselwood, who interleaved blank pages between the manuscript leaves and who began a transcript (one page) of the start of the play.\n\nWiggins modernizes the title to \"The Welsh Ambassador\" (7:468).

authorial hand in the manuscript matches that of Walter Mountfort's petition to the East India Company court (PRO C.O. 77\/4, art. 113, ff. 228-29).\n\nWhile there are generally no speech rules in the manuscript, a few sporadic rules have been added in places, probably at a later time (possibly in the ink that Mountfort used for his post-censorship revisions).\nFingerprints on ff. 325v, 332v, and

One (presumably by Thomas Drury) reads 'This differs very much from the other ms. copy which I have. The other copy does not contain the songs between the Acts.' The second reads 'This MS prepared in the form of a prompt book. J. Q. Adams.' Lower portion of the initial flyleaf is torn off, but the top of the recto contains the inscription 'The Lady Persalls Booke | borrowed 9r ye 1st 1653.'\n\nManuscript was transcribed by a single scribe in neat, legible hand using Caroline secretary script with elements of italic. Writing become larger and less tidy as the play progresses. Ink is black, fading to grey. Scribe was careful and accurate in transcribing, with 71 clear errors, though whether those errors were introduced by scribe or were in the original text in unclear. Corrections were frequently made with dampening and scraping the page, the resulting gap filled with flourishes and dashes. No discernable trace of the mistakes are left.\n\nCorrections were twice made, one is possibly a new hand, the other in a definite new hand. Both used italic and paler ink.\n\nThe presence of ruled lines and their impressions on subsequent pages has led some to scholars to deem this a prompt book. According to Bentley, 'This manuscript has been creased, and two of the creases used for margins, but the creasing is not according to the system found in several professional prompt manuscripts.' It is most likely not a prompt book, as the blind rules are purely for the scribe. It is a manuscript prepared for reading.","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"The Shepherds' Paradise","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"V.b.203","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":358,"value":"http:\/\/hamnet.folger.edu\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=234867","fieldName":"Link to Library Catalogue Entry","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5560","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"894","type":"76","title":"Date: 9 Jan 1633 \n| courtiers \n| Somerset House (London)","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"895","type":"76","title":"Date: 2 Feb 1633 \n| courtiers \n| Somerset House (London)","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1640","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":438,"value":{"id":"891","type":"51","title":"The Shepherds' Paradise Poynting, Sarah 1997","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Modern Editions","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":481,"value":"29.7 x 19.2","fieldName":"Dimensions","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1314,"value":"5659","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Genre (Manuscript)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1315,"value":"5573","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Genre (Modern)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1316,"value":"5590","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Language","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1407,"value":"1632","fieldName":"Composition Year","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1478,"value":"5602","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Author (Manuscript)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1479,"value":"5927","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Author (Modern)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1480,"value":"5608","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Holding Location","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1481,"value":"5931","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Paratext","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1481,"value":"5621","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Paratext","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1481,"value":"5611","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Paratext","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1481,"value":"5612","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Paratext","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1482,"value":"66","fieldName":"Foliation Count","fieldType":"float","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1485,"value":"5757","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Binding Material","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1486,"value":"5640","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Volume Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1491,"value":"1653: borrowed by Lady Francis Persall.

This hand also added the play's title on the verso of the final leaf.\n\nOne notable feature of the stage directions is that many of the entrance directions in the right margin--particularly those that start new scenes--appear between two horizontal rules or within a box.\n\nThe manuscript suffers from extensive damage and appears to be missing 2 leaves at the beginning (comprising probably 2 or 3 scenes). The first leaf is mostly decayed and part of the text is illegible. The bottom of the final leaf (f. 19) was cut off before 1803, resulting in the loss of what was apparently Sir Henry Herbert's license (though there is no other evidence of playhouse use or the Master of the Revels' censorship in the manuscript). Damp stains appear on the bottom of every page--particularly the earlier portion of the play--and align with the damp stains on the manuscript of \"The Welsh Embassador\".\n\nThe text of the missing license was recorded by G. Chalmers in his 1799 \"Supplemental Apology\" (p. 219):\n\n\"[1624] 3 November. For the Cockpit Company; A new Play, called, The Parliament of Love: Written by Massinger.\"\n\n\"The Parliament of Love\" was entered in the Stationers' Register by Humphrey Moseley on June 29, 1660 as part of an entry of eleven plays attributed to William Rowley, but it was evidently never printed (Lea claims that the extant manuscript is the one that Moseley had, but there is no evidence of this [vi]). The play is also named (as by William Rowley) among the list of manuscripts belonging to John Warburton and supposedly destroyed by his servant.\n\nThe manuscript of the play is bound into a single volume with the 1813 edition, F. G Waldron's 1805 manuscript contributions of speculations on the missing material which he gave to Gifford, and a letter from Edmond Malone (who thought the main hand in the manuscript was Massinger's own) to Gifford upon lending him the manuscript. During binding in the 19th century, blank leaves were interleaved between the manuscript pages.","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"The Parliament of Love","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"Dyce MS 39","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":358,"value":"https:\/\/nal-vam.on.worldcat.org\/oclc\/1008067323","fieldName":"Link to Library Catalogue Entry","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5555","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"873","type":"76","title":"Date: 1624 \n| Lady Elizabeth's Men \n| The Cockpit","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1624","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":422,"value":"1624-11-03","fieldName":"License Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"877","type":"78","title":"1624 Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Mixed","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"879","type":"78","title":"1624-1642 Non-authorial revision,Scribal correcting | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":437,"value":{"id":"888","type":"55","title":"Act-End Notations in Some Elizabethan Plays.

On the title page, the date \"1582\" has been erased and the name of \"Anthonius Cadus\" is given, as well as the note \"Descriptor ex autoris autographo, A. Cadi manu\", indicating that Cade made his copy from a manuscript that he believed to be authorial. Wiggins suggests Cade's transcription was made \"with a view to the text's being printed\" (2:228).\n\nA note by J. O. Halliwell on the flyleaf claims that \"the original of this play is in MS. in St. John's College Library\", but no such copy is extant. Halliwell also identifies the Gonville and Caius College copy and notes that the parchment in which that copy is bound \"is part of a Missal\" (the catalogue for the Clare College Library erroneously

Wiggins suggests Cade's transcription was made \"with a view to the text's being printed\" (2:228).\n\nA note by J. O. Halliwell on the flyleaf claims that \"the original of this play is in MS. in St. John's College Library\", but no such copy is extant. Halliwell also identifies the Gonville and Caius College copy and notes that the parchment in which that copy is bound \"is part of a Missal\" (the catalogue for the Clare College Library erroneously

William Lindsay Renwick, the Malone Society editor, argues for Greene on the basis of the play's relationship to \"Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay\"; McNeir supports Renwick's argument, though Wiggins considers the relationship between the play and its prequel to be insufficient grounds for the attribution (3:138).\n\nThis play might be the \"Play of Bacon\" for which Henslowe, on 14 December 1602, advanced Thomas Downton five shillings to pay Middleton for a new prologue and epilogue for a court performance. Possibly this court performance was one of the three plays the Lord Admiral's Men performed at Whitehall on 27 December 1602, Richmond on 6 March 1603, and (possibly) 8 March 1603. The other performances listed in this record relate to a play known as \"Friar Bacon\" in Henslowe's diary; presumably, this is that play.\n\nIn the manuscript, three stage directions name John Holland in the role of Ferdinand. Holland was an actor in Strange's Men and possibly Pembroke's Men around 1590-1593.\n\nThe speech prefixes are typically one to three lines too high, suggesting that the text of the speeches on each page was copied out and then the prefixes added after.\n\nRenwick argues that the play as it appears in the manuscript is a truncated version of a longer play (vii). The sequence for the manuscript's history that Renwick proposes is that a theatrical company around 1592 desired a shortened version of the complete play; after 1598 (when Chettle apparently became active in the theater) the same or another company wished to revive the play and had Chettle fill in a gap in the copy (Renwick, xiii).\n\nThe play was bound into a single volume with \"The Wasp\", probably around 1870-1872 (Renwick, v). Folio 13 was misbound in between f. 11 and f. 12.\n\nThe manuscript is heavily damaged in places and the final leaf is torn, resulting in the loss of most of the text on it.","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"Friar Bacon and John of Bordeaux","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"MS 507","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5555","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"408","type":"76","title":"Date: 19 Feb 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"409","type":"76","title":"Date: 25 Mar 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"410","type":"76","title":"Date: 25 Apr 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"411","type":"76","title":"Date: 6 May 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"412","type":"76","title":"Date: 10 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"413","type":"76","title":"Date: 17 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":413,"value":{"id":"414","type":"76","title":"Date: 30 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Performance","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5504","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5506","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1590-1599","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"439","type":"78","title":"Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"440","type":"78","title":"Theatrical revision | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"441","type":"78","title":"Theatrical revision | Unidentified, Italic","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"442","type":"78","title":"Authorial revision (subsequent) | Chettle, Henry, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"443","type":"78","title":"Authorial revision (subsequent) | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":437,"value":{"id":"415","type":"55","title":"Robert Greene and \"John of Bordeaux\".

Sir Edward Maunde Thompson suggested that two or three leaves are missing between f. 12 and 13, but as the Malone Society editor, Muriel St. Clare Byrne, points out, this is unlikely since there appears to be no lacuna in the text (St. Clare Byrne, v). Folio 14 of the manuscript, however, is evidently missing; St. Clare Byrne suggests that it might have had a character list (St. Clare Byrne, vi).\n\nThe original binding was made from the vellum of two medieval manuscripts; one of these leafs (the \"Compilatio Prima\" of Bernard of Pavia) was also used for the binding of the manuscript play \"Sir Thomas More\" (St. Clare Byrne, vi).","fieldName":"Detailed Description and Commentary","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"2-4"},{"dty_ID":132,"value":"John a Kent and John a Cumber","fieldName":"Title (Modern)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1009"},{"dty_ID":351,"value":"MS HM 500","fieldName":"Call Number","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":384,"value":"5555","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Play Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5505","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":414,"value":"5506","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Manuscript Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":421,"value":"1590-1596","fieldName":"Manuscript Date","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"355","type":"78","title":"1590-1596 Authorial copying,Authorial correcting | Munday, Anthony, Mixed","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"356","type":"78","title":"1590-1596 Theatrical revision | Hand C of \"Sir Thomas More\", Italic","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":429,"value":{"id":"357","type":"78","title":"12-1596 Marking\/comments (marginal or interlinear) | Unidentified, Italic","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Hands","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":438,"value":{"id":"359","type":"51","title":"John a Kent & John a Cumber St. Clare Byrne, Muriel 1923","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Modern Editions","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":438,"value":{"id":"361","type":"51","title":"An Edition of Anthony Munday's \"John a Kent and John a Cumber\" Pennell, Arthur 1980","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Modern Editions","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":481,"value":"31.75 x 20.32","fieldName":"Dimensions","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1314,"value":"5659","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Genre (Manuscript)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1315,"value":"5458","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Genre (Modern)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1316,"value":"5590","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Language","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1407,"value":"1585-1596","fieldName":"Composition Year","fieldType":"date","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1478,"value":"5804","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Author (Manuscript)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1479,"value":"5804","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Author (Modern)","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1480,"value":"5607","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Holding Location","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1482,"value":"13","fieldName":"Foliation Count","fieldType":"float","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1486,"value":"5640","termLabel":"","termCode":"","termConceptID":"","fieldName":"Volume Type","fieldType":"enum","conceptID":""},{"dty_ID":1491,"value":"17th century: owned by \"V.

Barber assumes that the play included an epilogue, but there is nothing in the extant manuscript that specifically requires this (Barber, 282).\n\nThe character list provides a plan for doubling for ten actors.\n\nPossibly intended for performance at Trinity College, Cambridge and later staged at the Kettering Grammar School. The author might have been Laurence Johnson (the scribal corrector who signed and dated the title page, \"Kettering die 20 Novembers Anno 1577) or Anthony Rudd (whose name appears on f. 1r). Other names in the manuscript include \"Thomas Rychardes\" (possibly the scribe), \"Thomas Ward\" on f. 1v (with the added note, \"1577, Barfold\"), \"W. Wyllm.\" on f. 11v (apparently in the role of Sir John), and \"John York. Iesu.\" on f. 17r (apparently in the role of Alison).\n\nBarber proposes that Rudd wrote the play between 1564 and 1577 for performance at Cambridge; when Laurence Johnson, master of the Kettering grammar school, needed a play, he remember Rudd's play from their college days and Richards made a copy of it for him. Johnson then made corrections. Then Richards added Rudd's name on the title-page to give him credit as author.

Expenses associated with the performance, including the making of the manuscripts, are given in Westminster Abbey Muniment 54000 (reproduced in Payne). The school paid 12d \"for paper otherwise bestowed on wryting owe the childrenes partes\", but these are no longer extant. In addition to the Queen's copy, four other copies were made, also bound in vellum with silk ribbon strings, but these are no longer extant. Two of these were written out -- \"thone in text, thither in romaine hande\" -- by \"Mr Allen his sonne\", who was paid 6s, 8d. The school spent: 17d \"for three quiar of fyne pap[er] for three copies of the saide Enterlude\"; 8d \"for twoo other quire of meane pap[er] for twoo other copies of the sayde entrelude\"; 2s for \"for the bynding of one copie in vellume with the Queenes ma[ies]tie hir armes & silk ribben stringes\"; 2s, 8d \"for the bynding of fowre other copies in vellum with stringes of sylke\"; 8d \"for vermilon to make redd nike for intremingling the L[ett]res of the sayde copies therewith\"; and 4d \"for blacke inke to wright the same\".\n\nThe red ink was used for decorations and for the speech prefixes. An entirely different ink was used on f. 5r for the added non sequitur line, \"Nulla dies sine linea\".\n\nPayne identifies a French watermark (not in Gravell): \"EDMONDE N18E\" (Payne, 45-46).\n\nOne of the other presentation copies was owned by Rev.

Treatises by Thomas Milles, Gerard Malynes, Edward Misselden, and Thomas Mun are considered alongside plays by William Shakespeare, Thomas Middleton, Walter Mountfort, Thomas Heywood, Ben Jonson, Philip Massinger, and Richard Brome. Adapting approaches pioneered by scholars of Science Studies and the Rhetoric of Economics, Bradley Ryner compares the formal features of mercantile treatises and plays. He argues that Renaissance playwrights crafted absorbingly self-reflexive models of economic exchange by making productive use of the imperfection of their metaphors, the representational instability of their props and characters, the necessarily limited vantage points of their audiences, and the interpretive energies and generic expectations of these audiences. He shows how these techniques facilitated thinking through questions that were pertinent to seventeenth-century audiences, such as how to conceptualise royal finanace, currency exchange, global trade, and poverty as part of a systemic totality -- an \u2018economy\u2019 in the modern sense.","fieldName":"Abstract (published)","fieldType":"blocktext","conceptID":"3-1010"},{"dty_ID":321,"value":"9780748684656","fieldName":"ISBN","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1011"}],"rec_RecTypeName":"Book","rec_RecTypeConceptID":"3-102"},{"rec_ID":"26","rec_RecTypeID":"10","rec_Title":"Ryner, Bradley","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 04:27:10","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":[{"dty_ID":1,"value":"Ryner","fieldName":"Family name","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"2-1"},{"dty_ID":18,"value":"Bradley","fieldName":"Given name(s)","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"2-18"}],"rec_RecTypeName":"Person","rec_RecTypeConceptID":"2-10"},{"rec_ID":"23","rec_RecTypeID":"51","rec_Title":"Separation Scenes: Domestic Drama in Early Modern England Christensen, Ann 2017","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 04:25:43","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":[{"dty_ID":1,"value":"Separation Scenes: Domestic Drama in Early Modern England","fieldName":"Title of book","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"2-1"},{"dty_ID":9,"value":"2017","fieldName":"Year","fieldType":"date","conceptID":"2-9"},{"dty_ID":15,"value":{"id":"24","type":"10","title":"Christensen, Ann","hhash":null},"fieldName":"Author or Creator","fieldType":"resource","conceptID":"2-15"},{"dty_ID":138,"value":"10.2307\/j.ctt1hxgb28","fieldName":"DOI","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1003"},{"dty_ID":312,"value":"318","fieldName":"Number of pages ","fieldType":"freetext","conceptID":"3-1001"},{"dty_ID":320,"value":"This analysis of five exemplary domestic plays\u2014the anonymous Arden of Faversham and A Warning for Fair Women (1590s), Thomas Heywood\u2019s A Woman Killed with Kindness (1607), Thomas Middleton\u2019s Women Beware Women (ca. 1613), and Walter Mountfort\u2019s The Launching of the Mary, or The Seaman\u2019s Honest Wife (1632)\u2014offers a new approach to the emerging ideology of the private and public, or what Ann C. Christensen terms \u201cthe tragedy of the separate spheres.\u201d Feminist scholarship has identified the fruitful gaps between theories and practices of household government in early modern Europe, while work on the global Renaissance attends to commercial expansion, cross-cultural encounters, and colonial settlements. Separation Scenes brings these critical concerns together to expose the intimate and disruptive relationships between the domestic culture and business culture of early modern England.\n \nSeparation Scenes argues that domestic plays make the absence of husbands for business the subject of tragedy by focusing not on where men traveled but on whom and what they left behind. Elements that critics have rightly associated with domestic tragedy\u2014adultery, sensational murders, and the lavishly articulated operations of domestic life\u2014define this world, which, Christensen argues, was equally shaped by the absence of husbands. Her interpretations of these domestic plays invite us to historicize and further complicate the seemingly universal binary between a feminine \u201cprivate sphere\u201d and a masculine \u201cpublic sphere.\u201d\n \nSeparation Scenes demonstrates how domestic drama played an active, dynamic, and critical role in deliberating the costs of commercial travel as it disrupted domestic conduct and prompted realignments within the home.","fieldName":"Abstract
